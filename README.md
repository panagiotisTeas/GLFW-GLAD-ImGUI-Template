# GLFW GLAD ImGUI Template

## Description

This project provides a simple **CMake template** for building *C/C++* graphics applications with the following libraries:

- **GLFW**
- **GLAD**
- **ImGui**

It’s intended as a lightweight starting point for OpenGL-based projects.

## Usage

Copy the contents of `dependencies/CMakeLists.txt` into your own project’s `CMakeLists.txt`.

If you don’t need ImGui, simply remove or comment out the ImGui-related section in `dependencies/CMakeLists.txt`.
